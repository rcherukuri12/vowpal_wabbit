Test suite for vw:
------------------

The perl script 'RunTests' drives the regression test.

It includes both the testing code and many vw test commands.
    
You may add arbitrary (train/test/varying-options) tests
by adding:
    1) Data (train, test, predict) files
    2) vw command to run (which may use the data files)
    3) Expected (reference) STDOUT, STDERR, and predictions-file
       for the command.

Additional tests can be added below the __DATA__ section in RunTests.

See the comment above __DATA__ in 'RunTests' for full details on
how to add more tests. You can also use the examples under __DATA__
as a tutorial/reference of working commands for each option.
